Problem Statement

Motivation: 5G networks enable sub-meter localization accuracy, creating
unprecedented surveillance capabilities that lack constitutional safeguards
and judicial oversight mechanisms.
Problem Statement: Current 5G positioning systems process location data
in plaintext through centralized Location Management Functions (LMF),
enabling potential mass surveillance without authorization controls or
privacy protections.

Methodology & Technical Approach
Simulation-Based Approach: Deploy complete 5G network simulation to
demonstrate privacy-preserving localization
5G Simulation Environment:
Core Network: Open5GS with AMF, SMF, UPF, and custom secure LMF
implementation
Radio Access: srsRAN-based gNB simulation with multiple base stations for
positioning
User Equipment: Simulated mobile devices with realistic mobility patterns
Positioning Methods: Implementation of Cell-ID, E-CID, OTDOA, and
Multi-RTT techniques

Privacy Enhancement: Demonstrate attack scenarios on standard 5G
localization and show how multi-party authorization and encrypted
processing prevent unauthorized surveillance

Privacy-Preserving Workflow Demonstration
Standard 5G Localization (Vulnerable)
1

Client Request: Law enforcement sends location request to AMF

2

Direct Processing: AMF forwards request to LMF without authorization
checks

3

Position Calculation: LMF collects measurements from gNBs in plaintext

4

Result Delivery: Precise coordinates returned immediately to client

5

Privacy Risk: No audit trail, no judicial oversight, potential for mass
surveillance

Privacy-Preserving 5G Localization (Secure)
1

Authorization Request: Client submits court order with digital signatures

2

Multi-Party Validation: Threshold signature verification (3-of-5: judicial,
law enforcement, operator, privacy officer, oversight)

3

Encrypted Processing: LMF performs positioning calculations on
encrypted measurement data using homomorphic encryption

4

Secure Communication: All data exchanges use secure network slice with
end-to-end encryption
