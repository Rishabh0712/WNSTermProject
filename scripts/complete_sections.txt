\subsection{Leveraging LLMs (AI Usage Declaration)}

AI tools were used throughout this project to accelerate development and documentation:

\textbf{Code Assistance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ChatGPT/GitHub Copilot:} Used for debugging OpenSSL BIGNUM operations, particularly modular arithmetic and memory management
    \item \textbf{Boilerplate Code:} Generated initial structure for RSA key handling and Lagrange interpolation loops
    \item \textbf{Bug Fixing:} Assisted in resolving segmentation faults related to BIGNUM operations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Documentation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Used AI to draft initial LaTeX structure for presentations and reports
    \item Generated mathematical notation formatting
    \item Assisted in converting technical notes to formal academic writing style
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Positive:} Accelerated development by 30-40\%
    \item \textbf{Corrections Required:} AI-generated code for modular inverse initially incorrect; manually corrected
    \item \textbf{Verification:} All AI-generated code was manually reviewed and validated
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Summary}

This project successfully demonstrated a critical privacy vulnerability in 5G positioning systems and proposed a cryptographic solution using multi-party threshold cryptography. We implemented a complete proof-of-concept system combining a 5G network simulation with Shamir's Secret Sharing-based authorization, achieving 100\% correctness with only 10-15\% performance overhead. The core cryptographic framework eliminates single points of failure in location data access, requiring collaboration of at least 3 out of 5 independent parties.

\subsection{Future Work}

Future enhancements would include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{End-to-End 5G Integration:} Modify OpenAirInterface AMF/LMF source code to integrate threshold authorization with distributed parties
    \item \textbf{Advanced Positioning:} Implement OTDOA and Multi-RTT for sub-meter accuracy
    \item \textbf{Post-Quantum Cryptography:} Replace RSA with lattice-based schemes (CRYSTALS-KYBER)
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimizations:} Parallelize chunk reconstruction, reduce overhead to $<$5ms
    \item \textbf{Production Deployment:} Kubernetes orchestration, load balancing, security audits
    \item \textbf{Standards Contribution:} Submit proposal to 3GPP SA3 Working Group
\end{enumerate}
